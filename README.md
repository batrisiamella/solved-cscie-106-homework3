Five observations on Y are to be taken when X = 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20, respectively. The true regression function is E(Y} = 20 + 4X, and the <em><sub>i </sub></em>are independent N(O, 25). (40 points, 10 points each)

a-) Generate five normal random numbers, with mean 0 and variance 25. Consider these random numbers as the error terms for the five Y observations at X = 4,8, 12, 16, and 20 and calculate <em>Y</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>Y</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>Y</em><sub>3</sub>, <em>Y</em><sub>4 </sub>, and <em>Y</em><sub>5</sub>. Obtain the least squares estimates <em>b</em><sub>0 </sub>and <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>, when fitting a straight line to the five cases. Also calculate <em>Y<sub>h </sub></em>when <em>X<sub>h </sub></em>= 10 and obtain a 95 percent confidence interval for E(<em>Y<sub>h</sub></em>) when <em>X<sub>h </sub></em>= 10. b-) Repeat part (a) 200 times, generating new random numbers each time.

c-) Make a frequency distribution of the 200 estimates <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the 200 estimates <em>b</em><sub>1</sub>. Are the results consistent with theoretical expectations?

d-) What proportion of the 200 confidence intervals for E(<em>Y<sub>h</sub></em>) when <em>X<sub>h </sub></em>= 10 include E(<em>Y<sub>h</sub></em>)? Is this result consistent with theoretical expectations?

<h1>Problem 2</h1>

Refer to the CDI data set (used in homework 1). The number of active physicians in a CDI (Y) is expected to be related to total population, number of hospital beds, and total personal income. Using <em>R</em><sup>2 </sup>as the criterion, which predictor variable accounts for the largest reduction in the variability in the number of active physicians? (20 Point)

<h1>Problem 3</h1>

Refer to the CDI data set (use in previous homework). For each geographic region, regress per capita income in a CDI (Y) against the percentage of individuals in a county having at least a bachelor’s degree (X). Obtain a separate interval estimate of <em>β</em><sub>1</sub>, for each region. Use a 90 percent confidence coefficient in each case. Do the regression lines for the different regions appear to have similar slopes? (20 points)

<h1>Problem 4</h1>

In a small-scale regression study, five observatiol)s on Y were obtained corresponding to X = 1, 4,10, ll, and

<ol start="14">

 <li>Assume that <em>σ </em>= .6, <em>β</em><sub>0 </sub>= 5, and <em>β</em><sub>1</sub>, = 3. (20 points, 10 points each) a-) What are the expected values MSR and MSE?</li>

</ol>

b-) For determining whether or not a regression relation exists, would it have been better or worse to have made the five observations at X = 6,7, 8, 9, and 1O? Why? Would the same answer apply if the principal purpose were to estimate the mean response for X = 8? Discuss.
